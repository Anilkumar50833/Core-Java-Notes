Naming Conventions in java
===========================
In java uppercase letters will consider as different and lowercase letters will consider as different that's why we consider java is a case sensitive programming language.

As java is a case sensitive ,we must and should follow naming conventions for following things.

ex:
	classes
	interfaces
	variables
	methods
	keywords
	packages and 
	constants 

classes
--------
In java, A class name must and should starts with upper case letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.
ex:
	Predefined classes		Userdefined classes
	-----------------		--------------------
	System 				Test
	String				ExampleApp 
	FileWriter 			MyExample 
	BufferedReader 			IhubTalentManagement
	and etc.			and etc.

interfaces
------------
In java, An interface name must and should starts with upper case letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.
ex:
	predefined interfaces		Userdefined interfaces
	----------------------		-----------------------
	Runnable 			ITest
	Serializable 			IExample 
	ListIterator 			IDemoApp
	Enumeration			ITalentManagement
	and etc.			and etc.

variables
-----------
In java, A variable name must and should starts with lower case letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.
ex:
	predefined variables		Userdefined variables
	---------------------		--------------------
	length				i
	out				empId
	err				studName
	in				deptNo 
	and etc.			and etc.

methods
------
In java, a method name starts with lower case letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.
ex:
	predefined methods		Userdefined methods
	------------------		-------------------
	getPriority()			getDetails()
	setName()			calculateBillAmt()
	hashCode()			getStudentInfo()
	getClass()			and etc.
	and etc.

keywords
----------
In java, all keywords we need to declare under lower case letters only.
ex:
	predefined keywords		
	--------------------		
	if				
	else
	public
	static
	void
	and etc.

packages
----------
In java, all packages we need to declare under lower case letters only.
ex:
	predefined packages		userdefined packages
	------------------		---------------------
	java.lang			ihubtalent		
	java.io				com.ihubtalent.www
	java.util			akhila
	java.util.stream		com.akhila.www
	java.text			and etc.
	java.sql
	and etc.

constants
----------
In java, all constants we need to declare under uppercase letters only.
ex:
	predefined constants 		Userdefined constants
	------------------		---------------------
	MAX_PRIORITY			N=10;
	MIN_PRIORITY
	NORM_PRIORITY
	MAX_VALUE
	MIN_VALUE
	and etc.


Interview Questions
=======================

Q)What is Java?

Java is a object oriented, platform independent , case sensitive, strongly typed 
checking, high level, open source programming language developed by James Gosling
in the year of 1995.



Q)Which is a default package in java?

	java.lang package

Q)What is the difference between JDK, JRE and JVM ? 

JDK
----
JDK stands for Java Development Kit.

It is a installable software which consist JRE (Java Runtime Environment), JVM (Java Virtual Machine), Compiler (javac), Interpreter (java),an Archiever (.jar), document generator (javadoc) and other tools needed for java application development. 

JRE
----
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.

JRE provides very good environment to run java applications only.


JVM
-----
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.

JVM is an interpreter which is used to execute our program line by line procedure.
