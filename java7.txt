Internal Architecture of JVM
=============================
Diagram: java7.1

Our java program contains java code instructions.Once if we compile the program, java code instructions converts to byte code instructions in .class file.

JVM will invoke a module called classloader/sub-system to load all the byte code instructions from .class file.The work of classloader is to check these byte code instructions are proper or not.If they are not proper ,it will refuse the execution.If they are proper it will allocate the memory.

We have five types of memories in java.

1)Method Area
-----------
	It contains code of a class, code of a variable and code of a method.

2)Heap
------
	Our object creations will store in heap area.

Note:
----
	Whenever JVM loads byte code instructions from .class file it will create
	method area and heap area automatically.


3)Java Stack
-----------
	Java methods will store in method area.But to execute those methods 
	we required some memory that memory will be allocated in java stack.

4)PC Register 
-----------
	It is a program counter register which is used to track the address
	of an instruction.
	
5)Native Method Stack
-------------------
	Java method will execute in method area.
	Similarly , native methods will execute in native method stack.
	But to execute native methods we required a program called Native method 
	inteface.

Execution engine
--------------
Execution engine contains interpreter and JIT compiler.

Whenever JVM loads byte code instructions from .class file , it will use interpreter and JIT compiler simultenously.

Interpreter is used to execute our program line by line procedure.

JIT compiler is used to increase the execution speed of our program.

Interview Questions
==================
Q)What is Native method in java?

A method which is created by using some other language is called native method.


Q)How many memories are there in java?

We have five memories in java.

1)Method Area
2)Heap Area
3)Java Stack
4)PC Register 
5)Native Method Stack


Q)What is JIT compiler?

JIT compiler is a part of a JVM which is used to increase the execution speed of our program.


Q)How many classloaders are there in java?

We have three predefined classloaders in java.

1)Bootstrap classloader (It loads rt.jar file)

2)Extension classloader (It loads all the jar files from ext folder)

3)Application/System classloader (It loads the .class file from classpath)



Q)Which is a default package in java?

	java.lang package
