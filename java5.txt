History of Java
================
In 1990, Sun Micro System took one project to develop a software called consumer electronic device which can be controlled by a remote like setup box.That time project was called Stealth project but later it is renamed to Green project.

James Gosling, Mike Sheradin and Patrick Naughton were there to develop the project.
They met in a place call Aspan/Colarado to start the work with Graphic System.James Gosling decided to use C and C++ languages to develop this project.But they problem what they have faced is , C and C++ language are system dependent.Then James Gosling decided why don't we create our own programming language? which is system independent.

In 1991, they have developed one programming language called an OAK.OAK means strength , it self is a coffee seed name and it is a national tree for many contries like Germany , France, USA and etc.

Late in 1995, they have renamed OAK to Java. Java is a island of an Indonasia where 
first coffee of seed was produced.During the development of project they were consuming lot of coffee's thats why symbol of java is a cup of coffee with saucer.
