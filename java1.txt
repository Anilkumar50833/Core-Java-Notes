Comments in Java
=================
Comments are created for documentation purpose.

It is highly recommanded to use comments in our regular programming.

Comments are used to improve readability of our code.

Comments are ignored by the compiler it means compiler won't compile the comments.Hence we won't get comments in output.

In Java, we have two types of comments.

1)Single Line Comment 
-------------------
	It is used to comment a single line.
	ex:
		// comment here 


2)Multiple Line Comment
--------------------
	It is used to comment a multiple lines.
	ex:
		/*

			-
			- comment here 
			-
		*/

ex:    
-----
//class declaration 
class  Example
{

	//main method
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{

		//output stmt
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}


Project
==========
Technically a project is a collection of modules.
ex:
	admin module 
	registration module
	login module
	payment module
	report generation module 
	and etc.

Every project contains two domains.

1)Technical Domain 

2)Functional Domain 
	
1)Technical Domain 
--------------------
It describes using which technology we developed our project.
ex:
	Java

2)Functional Domain 
----------------
It describes state of a project.
ex:
	Healthcare domain 
	Banking domain 
	Insaurance domain 
	ERP domain 
	and etc.
